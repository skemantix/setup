### 1982: [CBM 8096](http://thepcmuseum.com/commodore/cbm8096/default.htm)   
![](http://www.primrosebank.net/computers/pet/Commodore_CBM_ds.jpg)  

This was the very first computer I used extensively (at the age of 7) - a Commodore Business Machines 8032 Series, with a 64K daughterboard (RAM expansion).  My Dad was interested in the nascent home computing market, and brought me along to one of the early computer retailers in Toronto, ON when he decided to invest in the future.  We came home with the all-in-one CPU/monitor/keyboard and 2 (!) 5-1/4" floppy drives.  There was no money left for a printer :(
  
It incorporated Commodore Basic programming language in ROM (no OS!), had an 80-line green phosphor display, and gave me my first real taste for computing. Every Saturday morning, as my Dad enjoyed sleeping in, I was up early and sitting in front of this machine trying to figure out how play video games on it.  Unfortunately, software wasn't readily available, and expensive if you could find it.  When we went back to the same store where my Dad bought the computer and asked for some games, the gentleman behind the counter gave us a book.  In it was the Basic source code for several popular games, including MILLIPEDE, a variation of the Centipede game.
  
So it was that I set out to transpose, character by character, the entire source code of several of these games from the book to RAM, and eventually saved to external disk.  I remember the process being very unforgiving of typos and syntax mistakes, and it felt like at least a month of effort before I successfully saved my first game.  But I stuck with it and was rewarded with *FREE* video games *AT HOME* (this was a very big deal in the early 80's).

My first educational computer experience.  During my year of 4th grade at [Howard Junior Public School](http://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/howard/Home.aspx), the school received a shipment of Acorn educational computers for a new "lab" where students would be introduced to computing.  As I already had some experience with computers and was very excited about trying new hardware, I volunteered to help assemble the lab.  I still fondly recall the afternoon of unboxing each of the computers and accompanying RGB monitors, finding all the interconnect cables and assembling each workstation.  After the lab was complete, I was one of the first students to sit down and try my hand at the Acorn MOS system, which provided the familiar BASIC prompt.  Other than writing silly little GO TO echo loops, the only thing I recall doing on these machines was learning the [Logo educational programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)).  Anyone still remember the "Turtle"?


### 1986: [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64)

Finally, a computer I could play games on!!!  And did I ever play games on it.  By the time I was 11 years old, games were more readily available, and the 8-bit color graphics of the C64 was more like the quality of graphics experienced in the coin-op video arcades of the day.  The machine ran Commodore BASIC 2.0 (again, no OS), had dedicated "joystick" (game controller) ports, and was connected to the equally ubiqutous Commodore 1702 CRT video monitor.  The machine I used was also located on school premises, though tucked away in a MultiMedia studio run by a teacher who mentored me in extracurricular media production activities, Mr. Carson.  While I was supposed to be producing a short length stop motion Super-8 film, instead I was playing Spy Hunter, Winter Games, and my favorite, Raid on Bungeling Bay.

I first layed eyes on an Apple Macintosh computer in the summer of 1998.  A family friend had brought one to the cottage we were all staying at, and I couldn't keep my hands off of it!  I was blown away by the incredible detail of the graphic display, the GUI, and that "mouse thing".  When I discovered how much it cost, I quickly forgot any notion that I would ever get to use one.  
  
Fast forward a few years, and I was priveleged enough to get access to a Mac at my high school, Humberside Collegiate Institute.  I was actively involved in the music program while a student at Humberside, and the music department had a digital music lab tucked away in a room off one of the main band rooms.  In the lab was a full sized EnSoniq digital piano, a Roland drum machine, a MOTU MIDI interface and ... a Mac SE/30.  The teachers gave me access to the lab anytime I asked, provided no one else was using it.  After nearly a month of frustration trying to get the pieces of hardware to talk to each other over MIDI, I gave up and turned my attention solely to the Mac and the notation software on it.


### 1995: [Apple PowerBook 165c](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook/specs/mac_powerbook165c.html)

This was the first computer I owned. Purchased second-hand in my second year at University of Toronto at the UofT Bookstore Computer Shop, this was the first Apple laptop with a color display!  Weighing in at a whopping 7lbs and with a battery life of approx. 2hrs, it wasn't a laptop as much as a portable workstation.  This computer represents the beginning of my modern computing experience, as I used it in conjunction with a USRobotics Sportster 14.4 faxmodem to connect to the University of Toronto library network & the internet beyond.  The oldest email messages in my archives date back to when I used this machine to discover the power of connected computing.
